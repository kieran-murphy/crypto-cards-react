# Crypto Cards React

## About

My first medium sized react frontend project :)
This application uses the [coinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation) to fetch coin data about the top 200 cryptocurrencies at any time. 

These can be added to the dashboard and deleted and added again.

Each coin's previous performance for the past year can be viewed in a graph powered by [chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)

The animations for this application are powered by [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)

## How to use

To run this project simply download from github, `cd` into the directory and run `npm install` followed by `npm start`.

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

Alternatively the live web version can be found at this [link](https://kmurp62rulz.github.io/crypto-cards-react/)
